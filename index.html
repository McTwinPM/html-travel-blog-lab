        <p>Named after the Chickasaw Indian Nation, the Chickasaw National Recreation Area is fun place to be. We went water skiing at the Lake of the Arbuckles. We hiked along the trails to the Peaceful Valley of Ripling Waters. We visited the former Platt National Park and saw the larges Bromide Springs in the world. The Park has so many activities for everyone to enjoy!  </p>
